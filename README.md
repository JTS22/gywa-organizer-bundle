# gywa-organizer-bundle
This is a Contao-4-Bundle meant to adapt the folder structure inside the files-directory directly to the page structure.
To install it, search for the project in the contao-manager since this is a Managed Edition Plugin.

For the bundle to work, you need to have a folder called "daten" in the first level of your files-folder.
This is the folder all the folders for the pages will be created in.
